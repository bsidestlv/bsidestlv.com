## Wokwi for Embedded System Security Research

### Session details

Wokwi is an embedded system simulation tool that runs entirely in your browser / VSCode.
Wokwi is well known in the Maker / professional embedded development space and has many useful capabilities for embedded security research.

This workshop is intended to introduce Wokwi and its capabilities for security research.
In the workshop, we introduce Wokwi capabilities, which are helpful for security research, and demo their use.
These features include the Wokwi Logic analyzer, debugger, Profiler, WIFI Simulation, and packet capture.

The Workshop will include short exercises that help the participants understand the use cases in which these capabilities will be useful.
