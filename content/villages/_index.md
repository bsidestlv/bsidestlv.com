# BSidesTLV Villages

Saddle up, partners! BSidesTLV is striking gold in 2023 with a fresh new take on the wild west of cybersecurity. For the first time in the good, bad, and ugly world of this here rodeo, we're setting up camp with specialized hacker havens, known as "villages". Each settlement will be as unique as a rattlesnake's rattle, focusing on a different aspect of cybersecurity:

## Bug Bounties Village
The seasoned gunslinger Rotem Bar, famed far and wide for his uncanny knack for hunting down pesky code bugs, will be marshal of this town. This homestead is all about rallying the quickest draws in web application security, hackers, and tech enthusiasts. You can bet your boots there'll be plenty of gabbing, workshops, and Capture The Flag (CTF) contests to keep your hacker skills sharp as a spur​1​​2​.

## Hardware Hacking Village
This here is where the blacksmiths play. Antriksh Shah and Benni Meisels are the big cheeses in this burg, and they're aiming to teach you how to pry open those stubborn physical devices and expose their soft underbellies.

## Hello Cyber World Village
The posse known as Hackeriot is riding in to run this show. They're a group of pioneers blazing a trail for women on the cyber frontier, offering networking opportunities and a helping hand for those looking to stake their claim in the field. Their leadership suggests that this village might focus on these noble goals as well​​.

## Adversarial Mindset Village
This one's for those with a bit of the outlaw in them. It's all about learning how to think like the bad guys, emulating their tactics, techniques, and procedures to fortify your own defenses. After all, if you want to catch a bandit, you've got to think like a bandit.
