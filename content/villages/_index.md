## Agenda

### Opening Presentation - What is Bug Bounty and why should we care
by Rotem Bar

In this lecture, Rotem Bar provides an introduction to bug bounty programs. Why they are important for the community, and why they are vital for every company out there. We will discuss how to start in your bug hunting journey, if you are a complete beginner or only did pentests or other infosec activities, even developers can join the fight :)

### Israeli bug bounty programs intro

We will showcase different bug bounty programs and provide an overview of the bug bounty landscape in Israel, including the organizations that run bug bounty programs and the types of vulnerabilities they are interested in.

### SSRF Protections, From bounty report to mitigation
by Reuven Elezra, Appsflyer 

Inspired by a critical SSRF bug bounty report, we embarked on a transformative journey towards enhancing our security practices. Seeking guidance from the security community, we explored the best solution to address SSRF vulnerabilities. To develop a game-changing security library, we prioritized factors such as time efficiency and easy implementation. Our collaborative approach, backed by real-world analysis, led us to create an innovative library that provides robust SSRF protection while simplifying integration for developers.

### What The Fork? Gaining RCE into internal CI's at scale
by Moti Harmats 

CI/CD systems make great targets for attackers as they often run in privileged environments with access to sensitive secrets and internal systems.
It is not uncommon to treat INTERNAL CI's as INTERNAL systems that are not exposed to the internet, but the truth is that internal CI’s are just as exposed as your web API’s through version control systems such as GitHub & GitLab.

Although it is commonly known that untrusted & unreviewed pull requests should never be automatically merged to a repository’s main branch (a.k.a “master branch”) - CI pipelines tend to behave differently, they often “build first and ask questions later”.

In this talk Moti will show how this functionality can be exploited against public repositories, why vulnerable pipelines are so abundant and why DevEx / DevOps teams should always design their CI’s in an “assume breached” mindset.
Moti will showcase the attacks using a new open-source automation attack framework built by him!!

### Exploit TikTok: Our Journey to Finding an Account Takeover Vulnerability using XSS
by Amit Elbirt & Abir Nadav

Join us as Amit and Abir present their findings on a recently discovered vulnerability that could potentially compromise user accounts on TikTok. 
Through careful investigation and bug bounty participation, They identified and exploited a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. 

The presentation will provide an overview of the discovery process, including navigating the challenges posed by a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and demonstrating the potential impact through an OAuth authentication exploit. They will also discuss the timely response from TikTok in addressing the issue. 

This presentation offers valuable insights into the importance of robust security measures in today's digital landscape.


### Lightning talks

This session consists of lightning talks, which are short and concise presentations on various topics. The exact topics and speakers may vary, as registration is done on-site. Lightning talks provide an opportunity for different individuals to share their knowledge, experiences, or insights within a limited timeframe. Attendees can learn about diverse subjects and get a broad range of perspectives.

## Hardware Village at BSidesTLV

Howdy partner! For the first time in BSidesTLV history, we are excited to introduce the Hardware Village!

This year's event will host a range of engaging activities designed to immerse attendees in the world of Hardware research, exploitation, and design.

We invite you to join us in this groundbreaking initiative and be part of a collaborative effort to shape the future of cybersecurity.

## Our Vision

The Hardware Village is dedicated to exploring the world of hardware security and sharing knowledge across the community. We are looking to cover many topics in the Hardware security space such as Secure hardware design, verification of hardware, hardware attacks, and designing hardware attack tools.

We aim to bring vendors and security experts together to improve the security of the hardware which underlies all our digital society by understanding attack surfaces, attack methods, secure design concepts, and security processes.

At BSidesTLV, we’ll host technical talks, live demos, and a special workshop to give our attendees a deep dive into the current state of the Hardware security field from an offensive and a defensive perspective.

Whether you’re a seasoned cybersecurity pro or just starting out, we’ve got something for everyone. So saddle up and join us at the Hardware Village! Yeehaw!

## Agenda

### How to trust your open-source ASIC
**Leonid Azriel**

Open-source IC is not a new concept. Nevertheless, usage of open-source by the hardware community has been limited until recently. In the last few years, the introduction of the RISC-V open architecture helped to bring fresh energy to open-source IC, and many new projects have emerged. In addition to many benefits in productivity and quality, the open-source model contributes to product security by following the Kerckhoff's principle of open algorithm. However, unlike in software, in the IC world there is a long way from the source to the finished product, and it is hard to guarantee that the product indeed implements the algorithm as advertised. In this talk, I will discuss possible schemes, methodologies and policies to verify the compliance of the integrated circuit to the claimed open source and propose a scheme based on the existing Design-for-Test technology.

### CYMOCAN - An open-source USB CAN-FD adapter
**Benny Meisels**

CYMOCAN is a hardware tool which allows a Linux system to connect to a CAN bus over USB. The commercial products in this space can be very costly and some require software licenses. With CYMOCAN we aim to offer a cheaper alternative for hobbyists and professionals while also supporting both the CAN and CAN-FD protocols.

### Bolt-on security for existing and new designs with Secure Flash
**Nir Tasher**

Real world designs today suffer from profound security vulnerabilities. Regardless of platform type, once they are connected to any network, it opens up numerous attack vectors. Chaos agents exploit software vulnerabilities to upload and execute malicious code, with focus on making attacks persistent. Persistent attacks are much harder to detect and recover from, and allow the attackers to fine tune the timing and scale of their attacks. A persistent attack requires modification of the system non-volatile storage. The most sensitive and thus sought after is the boot loader. Pawning the system boot loader allows an attacker to achieve almost anything in terms of compromising the system and in many cases, the entire infrastructure. Protecting the non-volatile code storage, and in particular the boot loader, is the essence of the secure flash. The secure flash guarantees that code can only be modified by a trusted entity. It prevents rolling back the system to older code, and allows the system and infrastructure to create a root of trust for various operations such as platform attestation. And it offers this security hardening with almost zero changes to the system and existing software stack.

### Firmware security testing with Fault Injection Simulation
**Jan Jager**

I will address the effect Fault Injection has on the firmware and how to simulate fault injection attacks. I will demonstrate with a sample code with FI attacks before and after mitigation.

### Introduction to Correlation Power Analysis
**Yossi Oren & Michael Amar**

Introduction to transistors (and other electronic components) Power consumption: Representation and computation Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) CPA on AES step by step Exploring a Power-EM attacker setup.
