# Rules and Guidelines

1. This year we have 3 kinds of challenges:
    - Remote challenges
    - Local challenges (on site)
    - “0 knowledge” treasure hunt challenges (on site) – juniors this is for you!
1. We only allow physically present teams to claim a prize, make sure a member of your team is in the announcement ceremony!
1. We will contact winners using the email registered at the CTF Website. Use an email you monitor.
1. This is a game, play fairly - we reserve the right to disqualify participants (and we came pretty close to do that in the past)
1. Each team may be made of one or more individuals.
1. The winning team will get a collective prize which will be shared between the team participants.
<!-- 1. The CTF challenges are containerized and scalable, as such most web challenges use a sticky cookie called ‘BSidesTLV’ please make
sure to work with sessions to retain access to the same container -->
<!-- 1. For any persistency challenges with files, please note that we do an hourly cleanup of large and old files. -->
<!-- 1. Note: You must use the BSidesTLV cookie for the challenges to work properly if it is supplied (it is not part of the CTF just part of the infrastructure) -->

> We usually keep the challenges alive for a couple more days after the event to enable write-ups
