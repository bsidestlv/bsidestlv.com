# Rules and Guidelines

1. Remote participation is allowed (for all teams) this year
1. We only allow physically present teams to claim a prize, make sure a member of your team is in the announcement ceremony!
1. We will contact winners using the email registered at the [CTF Website](https://ctf.bsidestlv.com). Use an email you monitor.
1. This is a game, play fairly - we reserve the right to disqualify participants (and we came pretty close to do that in the past)
1. Each team may be made of one or more individuals
1. The CTF challenges are containerized and scalable, as such most web challenges use a sticky cookie called 'BSidesTLV' please make sure to work with sessions to retain access to the same container
1. For any persistency challenges with files, please note that we do an hourly cleanup of large and old files.
1. Team recommended size is 5 (limited to 10)
1. **Note**: You must use the BSidesTLV cookie for the challenges to work properly if it is supplied (it is not part of the CTF just part of the infrastructure)
1. We usually keep the challenges alive for a couple more (~1 week) days after the event to enable write-ups
