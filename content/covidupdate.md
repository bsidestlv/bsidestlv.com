Dear community members,

We want to inform you that two people who attended the conference have since tested positive for COVID19.

These participants walked around the lobby and attended lectures in the main auditorium all day long; one of them was also at the GE workshop at 14:00.

Please comply with the instructions of the ministry of health and consult with your doctor if you have any questions.

Stay safe & keep hacking
