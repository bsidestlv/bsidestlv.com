Dear community members,

We want to inform you that two people who attended the conference have since tested positive for COVID19.

These participants walked around the lobby and attended lectures in the main auditorium all day long; one of them was also at the GE workshop at 14:00.

You are getting this notification because according to our records you attended BSidesTLV 2021 conference which took place on July 22nd in Tel Aviv Univesrity, which means you might have been exposed as well.

Please comply with the instructions of the ministry of health and consult with your doctor if you have any questions.

Stay safe & keep hacking

BSidesTLV team
