I have been working at Imperva for the last 10 years.
As a security engineer, security content TL and for the last 5 years as a security researcher in web application and cloud data security.
I analyse CVEs and create mitigation rules, write research blogs, analyse traffic to detect new threats and write code and algorithms to detect attacks.
