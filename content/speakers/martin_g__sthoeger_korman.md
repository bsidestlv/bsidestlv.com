Currently working on the R&D team in Sygnia, working on new tools for the IR analysts in the company. Prior to that I worked in an incident response position in Sygnia for two years. Before joining Sygnia I worked at IBM's Trusteer as a malware researcher reversing & analyzing financial malware. I did military service in the software division of the IAF (Israeli Airforce) for 6 years in multiple DFIR & IT positions.
