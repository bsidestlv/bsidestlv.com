Gal is a 33 years old researcher from sunny Tel-Â­Aviv. Currently, he is keeping bad guys outside the internet as a senior member of Akamai's Threat Research team. He is an experienced "Full stack researcher" which poked anything between x86 malware binaries, ICS protocols and classic web security. He likes to share his thoughts and experiments on-stage using simple concepts and tools to demonstrate surprising results. Some of his previous work contains an evasion technique for sandboxes, a proof-of-concept malware built purely in copy-paste, and a free update-able vaccination framework.
