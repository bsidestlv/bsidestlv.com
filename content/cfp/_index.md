## Our CFP Review board

Our amazing CFP Review board members can be found [here]({{< relref "/team#cfpreviewboard" >}}).
This year, we will be employing a "Double Blind" review process! This means the reviewers won't be able to see any personal details of the submitters, and submitters will be able to receive anonymized feedback on their submissions.
