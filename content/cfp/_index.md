{{%/ hero %}} -->

## When: Thursday, June 27 , 2024

“Together we stand, Together we hack - ביחד ננצח, ביחד נפצח”

Dear friends and supporters.  
The time has come for us to regroup, organize and grow stronger - together.  
We are actively planning BSidesTLV 2024 for June 27, 2024 at Smolarz Auditorium, Tel Aviv University.  
Our theme this year will focus on the local community’s resilience and strength.  
We would like to feature stories of how security researchers and friendly hackers responded to the crisis and war going on in Israel since the October 7 attacks.

The 2024 edition of Security BSides in Israel, BSidesTLV 2024, is returning during Tel Aviv University's Cyber Week (June 23th - June 27th, 2024).

BSidesTLV will take place on Thursday, June 27th, 2024, from 09:00 am until 18:00 pm, and might even be followed by our traditional after-party.
