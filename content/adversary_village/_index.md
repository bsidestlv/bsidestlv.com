## Adversary Village at BSidesTLV

For the first time in BSidesTLV history, we are excited to introduce the Adversary Village!

This year's event will host a range of engaging activities designed to immerse attendees in the world of adversary simulation, emulation, malicious mindset, threat intelligence, and purple teaming. We invite you to join us in this groundbreaking initiative and be part of a collaborative effort to shape the future of cybersecurity.

## Our Vision

The Adversary Village is a dynamic and engaging community initiative that's all about Adversary simulation, Adversary Tactics, Life, Adversary Philosophy, Threat Actors Emulation, and Purple Teaming.

Our goal is to provide a platform for professionals and enthusiasts to hone their skills and develop new tactics, techniques, and procedures to combat modern cyber threats. 

At BSidesTLV, we'll host technical talks, live demos, panel discussions, and hands-on activities to help you explore the latest tools and techniques in Adversary simulation and Purple teaming and to help you understand better the attackers' mindset and TTP, to create better defensive and offensive capabilities.
