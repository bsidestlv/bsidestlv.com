### What is Security BSides, anyway?

Started by a group of hackers, security researchers and people passionate about cyber security, who are keen to share their knowledge and ideas, Security Bsides is a global network of community oriented, grassroots non-profit security events taking place anywhere from Athens, to São Paulo!

From the Bsides Community Wiki:  “Bsides creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening”.
