## Free ICS workshop!
The ICS for Hacker (Hands-On) Workshop introduces the world of Industrial Control Systems aimed at pen-testers without prior knowledge of ICS or SCADA systems. Participants will be introduced to fundamental ICS concepts and systems that are found across various industrial environments. We'll discuss and demonstrate common security issues in such systems and how they impact the overall industrial process. Then, participants will use the skills gained during the workshop to attack a mockup of an industrial system in a hands-on attack. The number of seats at the workshop is limited, and preference will be given to participants who have successfully completed the online challenge. Workshop participants will also enter a lottery for the chance to win a cool prize.
