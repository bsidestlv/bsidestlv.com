We'll explain the basic anatomy of boot flows as seen in modern embedded devices. Playing both sides of the constant designer vs attacker war: what are theâ€¯recommended architectures, good practices and errors to avoid. But even when the architects got it right, and the developers follow the best practices, you may find that there are still holes in your ship. We will illustrate that on real world examples that may lead to jeopardize the platform security. At the end, we will sink your u-boot.
