# Sponsors

We are happy to engage with you again this year as we are kicking off the 2022 edition of BSidesTLV.

This year our conference is going to be in a hybrid format - in-person and streaming online for our community. Our venue is the Smolarz Auditorium in Tel Aviv University and will be able to host up to 1200 people (in compliance with the Covid-19 regulations) in a big, wonderful, and air-conditioned space.

Our event takes place during [Tel Aviv University’s Cyber Week](https://cyberweek.tau.ac.il/).
Please reach out to [sponsors@bsidestlv.com](mailto:sponsors@bsidestlv.com) for setting up a call for more details!
