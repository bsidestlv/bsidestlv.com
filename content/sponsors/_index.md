# Sponsors

We are happy to engage with you again this year as we are kicking off the 2022 edition of BSidesTLV!  
This year the conference is going to be in a hybrid format - both in-person and streaming online for our community.

Our venue is the Smolarz Auditorium in Tel Aviv University and will be able to host up to 1200 people (in compliance with the Covid-19 regulations) in a big, wonderful, and air-conditioned space.

Please reach out to sponsors@bsidestlv.com for setting up a call for more details
