## That’s a wrap on BSidesTLV 2024 💙🇮🇱💙 - Thank you

Thank you for joining BSidesTLV 2024!  
With over 1,200 tickets sold, this year was sold out once again :)  
We are thankful and honored to serve our community, in particular during this difficult ear. Our theme "Together We Hack" focused on the local community’s resilience and strength, despite the crisis and war going on in Israel since the Oct 7 attacks.
