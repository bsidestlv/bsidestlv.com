## BSidesTLV 2025: "Comic Book Multiverse Edition - Everything is Possible"

Alerting all dimensions: BSidesTLV 2025 will take place on June 26, 2025 at Smolarz Auditorium, Tel Aviv University!

The theme for our 10th security research community conference will focus on alternate realities and multiple possibilities, imagining a better future while living in a chaotic present! In the age of disinformation, GenAI and Quantum Computers - we believe everything is possible (at least in the realm of security researchðŸ¤“ ).

Have an idea to share on our main stage? Join our local celebration of security research, creativity, and resilience. We welcome first time speakers and offer speaker mentoring and might be able to offer travel support for international (or interdimensional) speakers!
