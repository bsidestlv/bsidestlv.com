## BSidesTLV 2024

“Together we stand, Together we hack - יחד ננצח, יחד נפצח”

Dear friends and supporters.  
The time has come for us to regroup, organize and grow stronger - together.  
We are actively planning BSidesTLV 2024 for June 27, 2024 at Smolarz Auditorium, Tel Aviv University.  
Our theme this year will focus on the local community’s resilience and strength.  
We would like to feature stories of how security researchers and friendly hackers responded to the crisis and war going on in Israel since the October 7 attacks.

### Highlights of our event

- State of the art, modern & accessible auditorium - seats for 1200 participants
- Huge stage for live talks, networking and chillout areas, and sponsor zone!
