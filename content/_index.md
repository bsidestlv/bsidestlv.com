## BSidesTLV 2025 - new date announcement , 11.12.2025

### ðŸ“¢ Greetings Hackers & earthlings! 


Following the June 2025 postponement, we have an update about our new expected date: 
Tel Aviv University Cyber Week 2025 Will Take Place December 8-11. This means that our BSidesTLV2025 event is scheduled for December 11, Thursday! 

Most of our planned agenda and village content remain the same, and any current tickets will be valid for the new date. 

We will be in touch in September with event updates, info about electronic badges and more surprises.

We hope to see everyone there, and we thank you for your continued support!
The BSidesTLV 2025 team

The theme for our 10th security research community conference will focus on alternate realities and multiple possibilities, imagining a better future while living in a chaotic present! In the age of disinformation, GenAI and Quantum Computers - we believe everything is possible (at least in the realm of security researchðŸ¤“ ).

Have an idea to share on our main stage? Join our local celebration of security research, creativity, and resilience. We welcome first time speakers and offer speaker mentoring and might be able to offer travel support for international (or interdimensional) speakers!
