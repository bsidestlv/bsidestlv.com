## Thatâ€™s a wrap on BSidesTLV 2024 ðŸ’™ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±ðŸ’™ - Thank you

Thank you for joining BSidesTLV 2024!  
With over 1,200 tickets sold, this year was sold out once again :)  
We are thankful and honored to serve our community, in particular during this difficult ear. Our theme "Together We Hack" focused on the local communityâ€™s resilience and strength, despite the crisis and war going on in Israel since the Oct 7 attacks.
