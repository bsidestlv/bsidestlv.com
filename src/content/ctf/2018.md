## Running a Fair Game

_This excerpt is from an incident that occurred during the CTF._

On June 9th at 18:26 we discovered that someone had shared the flag for one of our challenges on Pastebin.

We made a decision to trust our community and believe the vast majority of teams played fairly. However, we couldn't let a flag worth 1,000 points run around free — so we modified the challenge slightly to include another step in flag creation, making the original flag obsolete.

Please play fairly! Both for your sake, and for the fun of everyone else!
